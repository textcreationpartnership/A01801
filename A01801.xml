            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

O the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable force of ſinne, that whereas nothing is able to break the hedge of the Lords vineyard, the Lyon, nor the wilde Bore, yet our ſins are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make a breach: &amp; as one speaketh; The Lord is a ſtrong <hi>Sampſon:</hi> but yet our ſins, are as a razor, by which we take away, as it were, his ſtrength, and by which wee doe, as it were, ſhaue the heade of that great <hi>Sampſon</hi> our

No other target or ſworde, no other gate to ſhut out the deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then this. Theſe are mans, or rather the Chriſtians weapons. God hath giuen to euery liuing creature his weapon to defend himſelfe and to reſiſt; to the Bee his ſting, to the Bull his hornes, to the Cocke his ſpurres, to the Horſe his heeles, to the Beare, his pawes, to the Elephant his ſnoute, to the Lyon his teeth, to the Fiſh his ſinnes: but to man or a Chriſtian, hee hath giuen one more forcible then all the reſt, repentance and prayer, fit weapons to reſiſt and to keepe out the ſlaying Angell, and the Lords armie.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:19380:6"/>
            <p>Now, that wee might be skilfull in the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of them, this Treatiſe ſetteth, before our eyes, <hi>DAVID,</hi> a skilfull capitaine. Eſteem not (Right Honourable and Worſhipfull) that it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth too late, &amp; out of time: for as after the taking in of cities, there is a pourtrature and Mappe drawne of the ſiege and taking in, and of the manner thereof, with a deſcription of the traitors which haue betrayed it, or of the cauſe of their weakneſſe and vnability to reſiſt, and that for the inſtruction of others, that therein they might learne, where to amende the fault, and the meanes how to keepe out another time the enemie: So likewiſe, after the beſieging and taking in of your honourable citie, by the Lord of Hoſtes and his Angell, beholde, I haue made a pourtrature, and drawne a Mappe of the manner of the cauſes of our weakeneſſe, of the traitours which haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed it, to ſhewe hereby the meanes to ſtoppe the breach, and the way to reſiſt, if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne againe the next ſommer, or any other time. For although, now in the winter ſeaſon, our enemie the peſtile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ceaſeth to anoy vs, yet he may perhaps the next ſpring returne, if we take not heed. For, the plague is like vnto Kings and Princes in the beſieging of cities: in the winter ſeaſon, they commonly retyre, the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the winter ſuffering them not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue;
<pb facs="tcp:19380:6"/> but when the Sommer appeareth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde they are in armes, and come before the citie, deſtroying, burning, and ſhooting. In the ſame manner, the Plague which ceaſed in the winter, returneth often in the ſommer. And therefore let vs not become careleſſe Soldiers. Great hath beene the diligence (by the commandement of our wiſe and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Prince) of the spirituall Captaines in your citie, to traine vp the Lords Soldiers, and to teach them to handle theſe weapons; paiſe-worthy haue beene the weekely mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrings in the Lords fielde, I meane, your weekely faſtings in the congregation through the whole citie; wee haue experience of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, for wee haue ouercome the inuincible Lord, and cauſed him to retire. But let vs not therefore giue our ſelues to ſecurity, and lay aſide theſe weapons: but rather, as the citizens who are in doubt of the enemies returning, let vs continually watch and pray, <hi>Luk. 21.</hi> that if hee returne, wee bee not vnprouided: let vs not tarry to take them, vntill the Lord enter the citie, as wee haue done, leaſt wee ſmart for it againe. <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the great, being readie to giue an aſſault, ſawe one of his Souldiers then firſt to take his buckler in hand, and viewing it to try if it were ſtrong enough: for which negligence hee
<pb facs="tcp:19380:7"/> displaced him, and puniſhed him; let vs alſo take heede, that wee ſuffer not a iuſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for our procraſtination and delay. To auoide the ſame, (becauſe the prints or markes of gods correcting hand are yet to bee ſeene, and the noyſe of the mournings and gronings of manie, doe yet ſounde in our eares) giue mee leaue (Right Honourable and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full) to giue vnto you,<note place="margin">Good counſel for the citie.</note> and to the whole ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> a twofolde counſell.

<pb facs="tcp:19380:21"/> tree with a double hedge of a twofold death, yet it was ſo forcible, that they became infected with the plague of the ſoule, which plague manifeſted it ſelfe with many Deuils tokens: diſobedience, apoſtaſie, infidelitie, pride, ambition, and other more, this ayre then hath infected DAVID, and poyſoned his heart. Some deny that the ayre doth infect, and affirme that an Angell doth it, I diſpute not therof, but to apply this to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I may ſay that an Angell doth infect men with the Plague of the ſoule, but it is an Angel of darkneſſe. As an Angel of heauen ſmote the IS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RALITES with the bodily peſtilence, ſo an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell of hell ſmote DAVID their King with the ſpirituall peſtilence:<note place="margin">2 The inward cauſe of it.

And thus much for the ayre which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the king.

Peace, proſperitie, &amp; idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, are as it were a contagious ayre, which ſmiteth vs with the Plague of the ſoule.

As euill and corrupted humours through idleneſſe are ingendred in the body: So in peace and proſperitie, bad and pernitious humours are ingendred in the ſoule.

If thou art deſirous to know when the Satanicall aire hath moſt force; It is in the time of peace and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, when thy heart is at eaſe, and that thou haſt giuen thy ſelfe to ſecuritie: For he obſerueth three things; the time, the place, the occaſion.

Fourthly for the ſimilitude which it hath with the corporall Plague in diuers things, as I haue already ſhewen and yet will amplyfie in this Kings Euill. As the corporall Plague doeth manifeſt it ſelfe with Biles and Carbuncles, yea ſometime with fiue, ſixe, ſeauen, or more: So likewiſe in this Plague of the ſoule, wherewith DAVID hath been infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, diuers peſtilentiall vlcers are to be ſeene.

The firſt Deuils token,<note place="margin">The Deuils tokens to be ſeene in the Kings euill.</note> hath bene Pride; for to the numbring of the people, the king hath bene mooued by the pride of his heart, and ſeeketh as it were to glory in the arme of the fleſh, &amp; in the multitude of the people: As NEBVCHAD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NEZER in the greatnes and magnificencie of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> royall Babell.</p>
               <p>The ſecond hath bene Ambition, which is, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> BERNARD ſpeaketh, <hi>Secretum venenum,</hi> a ſecrete ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome: He did ſeeme hereby, to let others know, to what a glorie he had brought the kingdome, and ouer how great a multitude he did raigne.

The fourth, is the kings curioſity, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> his tongue betraieth him. 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.2 (that I may know the number of the people) he rendreth no juſt cauſe. Wee are all deſirous by nature to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto knowledge, ſaieth ARISTOTLE, which is not to be diſcommended, but our knowledge muſt be directed to a lawfull end and ſcope, for if it doth conſiſt in the limits of DAVID, that wee might onely know, it doth degenerate in curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, which is, as that hony-father BERNARD ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, <hi>Primus ſuper biae gradus:</hi> the firſt degree of pride.

This infection is very generall, ſpreading it ſelfe farre and wide. The fift Deuils-token is his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> and tranſgreſſion of the Law; for hee hath violated both the Eccleſiaſticall and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall numbring of the people.

The ſixt &amp; laſt deuils-token, is the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> kings obſtinacie in his purpoſe. 1. <hi>Chro.</hi> 21.3.4.

Touching the firſt; as the Phyſition, when he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth counſel to the patient, either to perſwade or diſſwade, produceth his reaſons, and ſheweth the danger: So IOAB counſelling DAVID to flie this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanical aire, produceth two reaſons, drawne from the danger: The firſt reſpecteth the Kings perſon:<note place="margin">Ioabs cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert Dauid of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, with to reaſons.</note> in the firſt part of the third <hi>verſ.</hi> The ſecond, the kings ſubjects, in the latter part of the ver. But <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> rejecting the Phyſitions counſell, would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his own minde &amp; appetite, for the kings word preuailed againſt IOAB, &amp; ſo ran wilfully into the plague. Thus I haue anatomized the kings euil, &amp; ſhewen, that although at the firſt view it ſeemeth nothing, yet the wound being ript ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth thereout great quantitie of poyſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Satan which ſtood vp againſt him, hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued him, hee ſhewed him his great power, his victories, and the multitude of the people: but hee couered the filthineſſe of the ſinne, and the indignation of the Lorde, with the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger which ſhould enſue, being like vnto the Panther, of whome it is written, that knowing
<pb facs="tcp:19380:26"/> how beaſtes flie from him by reaſon of his vgly head, which fraies them; thruſts onely his head in ſome ſecrete corner, whileſt they, gazing on his goodly ſpotted hide, nothing ſuſpecting their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching end, ſuddenly he breaketh out, &amp; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vpon them. So this foule-headed Panther Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, perceiuing well how much delight men take in worldly pleaſures, and in the glorie of this world; hideth his deformed head, and the filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinne, ſetteth forth onely his fine coloured skinne, that is, the glorie and vanitie of pleaſant, but dangerous delights; whileſt in the meane time, they neglecting their enemie, he ſudde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trappeth them. I leaue Satan, and returne to IOAB, hee who before playde the Phyſition, needeth a Phyſition himſelfe: and obeyeth the appetite of the patient, which hee knew would be hurtfull to the head, and to the body, to the king and to the ſubjects: Yee that ſeeke to binde vp the ſores and wounds of others, be not careleſſe of your owne ſores, that to you be not ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. <hi>Phyſition firſt heale thy ſelfe.</hi>

As the corporall Plague is often a good while in the body, and hee that hath it, knoweth nor feeleth it not: ſo likewiſe, the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Plague hath often infected many, and they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:19380:26"/> feele nor know it, as here we ſee in DAVID. The Phyſitions do ſay, that there be ſeauen kinde of Agues or Feauers; a continuall Feauer, a quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidian, a tertian, a quartan (with which the Lyon is ſometimes ſicke) the Feauer Hectick, the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering feauer, that keepeth no certain fits; &amp; laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that which laſteth but a day. The Plague of the ſoule (as you ſee) is not a Feauer of one day, it la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted nine Moneths in DAVID, &amp; he knew it not. This kings euill may be compared vnto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall Feauer; wee haue all of vs continually ſome ſparkes of pride and ambition in vs; the one more, the other leſſe; and principally, the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Princes and great men are troubled with it.

But alas, great hath bene our obſtinacie, we haue as bad patients follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our owne humours, rejected the counſell of the ſpirituall phyſitions, and our pride, ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſpirituall idolatrie, curioſitie, and diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, haue preuiled againſt them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord hath ſent a peſtile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in England, &amp; there dyed not yet (I am perſwaded) ſeauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand. If in the ſecond place, I ſet before our eyes, DAVIDS ſubjects, as a looking glaſſe, therin (alas) we may diſcry the bleamiſhes of
<pb facs="tcp:19380:37"/> our faces; Firſt, they had a famine.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Sa.</hi> 21.1.</note> But the Lord remooued that in his mercie, and gaue them peace and proſperitie, and yet they wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wanton and inſolent.<note place="margin" type="runSum">1592</note> Since the laſt peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, there hath bene a dearth in England, in the daies of ELIZABETH, but the Lord hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it away in his mercie, and giuen plenty and choiſe, ſtore of earthly treaſures: we haue ſince ſeene and taſted how friendly the Lord is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. his mercies haue bene multiplyed vpon vs, euen like vnto the dewe of Hermon, that wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the dry earth, that gaped for it. His bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings both Temporall and ſpirituall haue bene as two hands to draw vs home to him, and yet wee haue bene like to DAVIDS ſubjects. As for their ſeconde ſinne, ſhall I bee ſo bolde to accuſe ſome thereof? Not I, but the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and euente of the former yeere, doeth Preach it to the whole Kingdome. The Londe hath giuen vs a gratious DAVID, a man after Gods owne heart, and as I may ſpeake, a man after our owne heart; and yet, beholde, as ſome male-contented Iſraelites, haue ſought DAVIDS ruine, an enuious SE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BAH, an ambitious ABSOLON,<note place="margin">A note out of the 2 Sam 2, agreeing with that which hath hapned the formes yere</note> a falſe-harted ACHITOPHEL a ſeditious ABNER: ſo ſome haue bene enuious with Satan, of our DAVIDS felicity. And note this with mee, which I haue obſerued out of the ſecond booke of <hi>Sam.</hi> the 2 <hi>chap.</hi> that as in the firſt yeere of king DAVIDS
<pb facs="tcp:19380:38"/> raigne, DAVID being but newly crowned king of Iſrael, euen then beholde, there was found a ſeditious ABNER, and ASAHEL, and an ISBO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SHETH, which roſe vp againſt DAVID: So in the firſt yeere of the raigne of our DAVID, euen then, hee being but newly crowned king of England, as DAVID was king of Iſrael: behold, ſome ABNERS, ASAHELS, and ISBOSHETHS a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their ſacred and annoynted Prince. But let this be our comfort, in the tenth verſe of that Chapter, that the houſe of Iudah hath fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed DAVID, the companie of the true Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors and Confeſſors of God, and that ABNER and his adherents are fallen before the ſeruants of DAVID. Seeing then we are guiltie all of the firſt ſinne, and ſome of the ſecond: the Lord hath dealt juſtly with vs, as with the ſubjects of DAVID, ſending vnto vs (as he did to them) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a famine, or a dearth, a peſtilence: So that the wrath of the Lord, hauing been againe kindled againſt vs, no bodie needeth to make an objection againſt his juſtice for our inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, as it might haue been done for ISRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>EL.

               <p>To particularize;<note place="margin">1 A viſitation of ſorrowe with the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals of a Noble Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe.</note> The firſt hath bene a viſitation of ſorrowe, and the funeralles of a Prince in the beginning of the yeere: the Lord firſt viſiting with ſickneſſe, and afterwardes taking away that Noble Princeſſe of famous memorie; that worthie inſtrument of Gods glory, by whoſe ſacred Scepter the faithful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant (aſwel we ſtrangers, as the natural inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants) haue found a ſecure and fertile nurcery. At that time, ô the ſighes of the righteous! ô the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaints of the godly! ô the feare &amp; doubting of many! <hi>Spemque metumque inter dubij,</hi> ſome fearing, ſome hoping.<note place="margin">2 Chro. 35</note> Then as IOSIAS was

This began a little to mooue vs, as it were, to taſte the medicine of repentance: for the death of a good Prince is one of the Lords Preachers, &amp; to make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny at that time to pray vnto the Lord, that hee would be mindfull of Sion, and not permit vs to fall againe in the ſuperſtitions of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt. This part of the tragedy ended, behold, there followed the ſecond alteration, the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ioy and mercie: the proclamation of a new Prince, and afterward his ioyfull Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. At that time, ô the admirable ioy, euen from <hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Berſhebah,</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:19380:44"/> land was as it were laid down in the bed of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, but by the ſecond, there aroſe a new Sun, whoſe beames were comfortable to the whole land. This then hath bin another of the Lords Preach<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rs. But hath this mooued vs, either to continue or to goe forward in the waies of the Lord? alas, wee haue not altered the colour or haire of our heads, nor added one inch to our ſtature ſince all theſe thinges haue bin accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed among vs: our hearts haue bene as the adamant, that the impieſſion of Gods graces haue not entred. And therefore there followed the third viſitation, of ſorrow &amp; lamentation, the deluge of the Peſtilence, the ſecond Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. The funeralls of whole families, and the funeralles of a Princely Cittie, which was as it were going to her graue, if the Lord in his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy had not commaunded his Angel to put vp his ſword into the ſcabberd: this was an other kinde of Preacher. The conſideration of the ſecond viſitation,<note place="margin">3 A newe viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>row, with the funerals of a princely citie.</note> had made vs to ſay in our hearts with DAVID in his proſperitie. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 30. I ſhall neuer be mooued. The Peſtilence of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie did beginne to raigne among vs, I doe appeale vnto the words &amp; ſpeeches of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants which then were vſed in the Lande; and therefore the Lord came, and mingled our joy with ſorrow, &amp; ſprinckled a little ſalt ouer the joy of the country, and by a mortalitie, hee did put vs in minde of our mortality. As Chriſt
<pb facs="tcp:19380:45"/> ſhewed vnto PETER, and the reſt vpon the Mountaine, when they were in the midſt of their joye; and that PETER ſaid, Let vs make heere three tabernacles: as hee ſhewed I ſay to them, MOSES and ELIAS, which were dead men, Euen ſo in the midſt of our ioy and glory, when wee were ſaying, It is good to bee heere, and to make our tabernacles heere: euen then he ſhewed vnto vs MOSES and ELIAS, and ſent vs a mortallity. It was vſuall amongſt the Egiptians, that in the middeſt of their feaſts, &amp; ſolemnities, a reſemblance of death, all trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and ſhaking, was brought and carryed round about, to make them remember it, &amp; to learne ſobrietie. Euen ſo, in the midſt of our ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities, for the joye of a newe Prince, death hath been carried round about the Land, that we ſhould not waxe to wanton, and forget the Lord. It is ſtoried that when the Emperours were crowned, the Sepulchers of dead men were ſhewed vnto them, to make them minde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of death: euen ſo, when our King the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer yeere was Crowned, the Lord hath ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en vnto him, and to vs, the Sepulchers of dead men, and by the continuall allarum of Bels, put vs in minde of death: which mindfulneſſe, as CASSiANVS an ancient writer ſpeaketh, is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall reſtraint from euil Let this Preacher, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued of London teach you, that as IOSEPH of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> had a ſepulchre in the midſt of his

               <p>To proceed, I told you beloued before, that the Lord by the ſmart-Preacher of his juſtice and anger, hath croſſed vs two maner of waies: Firſt puniſhing vs as it were by Retaliation, for our glorying in the number and multitude, with a diminution. Secondly, by contraries:<note place="margin">2 The ſecond thing, where in the Lorde hath croſſed vs, namely, by contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> The firſt hitherto I haue amplifyed; Now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the ſecond; obſerue them with me, how wonderfully the Lorde the former yeere by the deluge of the Peſtilence hath in diuers things croſſed our expectation: Firſt, which wee had ſpoken: Secondly, expected: Thirdly, begunne. Firſt, we had ſaid and expected,<note place="margin">1 Encreaſe of people was expected.</note> that the number and multitudes of people ſhould haue bene augmented, both in the citie, and in the Land: and behold, there hath bene a juſt contrarie, it hath bene diminiſhed in both, ô howe many thouſandes haue bene buryed! Howe haue the Church-yeardes beene fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vppe, that ſcarce there was no place?
<pb facs="tcp:19380:46"/> hath not the Lorde ſhewen the trueth of that threatning? <hi>Ier.</hi> 7.32. They ſhall bury in <hi>Top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heth,</hi> till there be no place? Secondly, wee had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſaid and expected, that multitudes againſt the Coronation would come, both in the citie and in the Land: and beholde a contrary, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes haue departed out of Both; ſome lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the citie, others the Land. Thirdly, wee had expected, that euen our ſtreetes ſhould haue bene filled with joyes and tryumphs,<note place="margin">3 Tryumphs</note> &amp; that therein we ſhould haue ſhewen the ſignes thereof: and behold a contrary, they haue bene filled with ſorow, mourning, weeping &amp; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, for the funerals which haue walked along them. Theſe haue bene the tryumphs of LON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DON; We expected in our ſtreetes the ſound of the Trumpets,<note place="margin">The try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs of the laſt yere</note> and the ſweete harmonie of Muſicke to welcome our Prince; and behold, in ſteede of them, wee haue heard a contrary muſicke; the continuall knels of Belles to wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come death: we expected ſhewes of tryumphs, &amp; behold, other ſhewes we haue ſeene, the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals of dead men, who were gone to try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in heauen. We had begun to builde to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heauen, almoſt as high as the builders of Babell: euery one for higheſt and fineſt, ô the great preparations and diligence in their buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and erecting? But behold, a ſuddaine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, a ſtay of their worke; where ſome had ſet vp, others plucke downe: and as the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb facs="tcp:19380:46"/> of Babel haue bene diſperſed, euen ſo ours haue bene ſcattered: Some are dead, and ſome yet left a liue: The Lord hath ſent ſome of them, from their downe-beds, to their duſt-beds. And as the arrow came ſuddainly from IEHV his bowe, and ſtroke IORAM euen in his Chariot. 2. <hi>Reg.</hi> 9.28. euen ſo, the Peſtilence, the Lordes flying arrow, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. hath ſtrooke ſome, euen in the midſt of their tryumph: he changed our glorie into ſhame. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.7. and fulfilled that threatning by the Prophet, <hi>Ier.</hi> 7.34. <hi>I will cauſe to ceaſe from the cities of Iudah, and from the ſtreetes of Ieruſalem, the voice of myrth, and the voice of gladneſſe.</hi> So that with HESE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHIAS <hi>Eſa.</hi> 38.17. Thou haſt, ô London had occaſion to ſay: Behold, for felicitie I had bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter griefe, but it was thy pleaſure to deliuer my ſoule from the pit of corruption. Fourthly, wee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> had expected profite,<note place="margin">Profite</note> and that the traficke ſhould haue flouriſhed, moreouer, that now we ſhould haue aduentured, where before many kept themſelues cloſe and durſt not. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny had brought vp great ſtore of pretious wares, thinking that neuer they had had ſuch a time: and yet beholde a contrarie, the traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick, both of the mother-citie, &amp; of the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, of the head and of the members, hath bene ſlacke, doings little or none, no aduenturing, litle paying; wares eſteemed better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> debts, and euery one keeping cloſe: ſo that wee haue
<pb facs="tcp:19380:47"/> had occaſion to vſe the ſaying of the Prophet <hi>Iere.</hi> 8.15. We looked for peace, but no good came, and for a time of health, and beheld trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. Further we expected that our ſhops ſhold haue bin open in that ioyfull time, which were furniſhed with great riches againſt the future triumph, thinking to reape great profit, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde a contrary, many haue bin lockt vp, by reaſon of a double departure, of ſome out of the citty, of others out of this world. The Lord hath taken away from vs our markets and faires the greateſt ſtayes of the common wealth, and from thee ô London that renowned BARTHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEMEVV faire, and the ſportes thereof, wraſtling and Shooting: and inſteed of them, there haue bin wraſtling againſt death, &amp; the Lords An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, ſhooting off the Lords arrowes. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. The reaſon of this, all hath been becauſe the Lord would haue vs profit not by our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, but by his chaſtiſements. It is reported that the mountaines which are full of golden mines, that they are commonly barren and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitefull: we by reaſon of our riches were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitefull and barren in good workes, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord by his rod would make vs fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and to reape profit for our ſoules. Laſtly, many had made preparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s againſt the future tryumph, to adorne themſelues, and to meete their Prince: and beholde a contrarie, ſome of them haue been adorned with a ſhrou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="tcp:19380:47"/> ſheete, and ſo are gone to meete another Prince in another kingdome, to tryumph eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.</p>
               <p>It hath fallen out ô London with thee and thy inhabitantes, as with the Emperour SALA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DINVS, after he had gotten great victories, and had tryumphed; fell ſicke &amp; had nothing car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried before him to his graue then a ſhrouding ſheete: &amp; what elſe haue had many of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitantes? Thus then beloued, the Lord hath ſpiced your great ioyes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the yeere, with ſorrow and bitterneſſe. If you would know the reaſon; that you ſhold not forget eyther the Lord or your ſelues, for if you had ſurfeted of pleaſure, and receiued to much good, it would haue bin as an introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to worſe to come. When tydings was brought to PHILLIP of <hi>Macedon.</hi> Firſt that PARMENIO got the victorye ouer his enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, Secondly ALEXANDER his ſon was borne, And thirdly his Chariots wonne the prize at <hi>Olympus</hi> all in one day, he called vpon fortune to doe him ſome little hurt, &amp; to ſpice his ioyes with bitterneſſe, that they ſhould not make him forget himſelfe. Euen ſo ô England, ſeeing that thou haſt firſt obtained a vertuous Prince, a wonder of the world, ſecondly victories ouer thy enemies of <hi>Ireland,</hi> &amp; thirdly aboundance of Corne and fruits of the earth, and that all in one yeere; it hath been good, that the Lord
<pb facs="tcp:19380:48"/> hath done thee ſome little hurte, and ſpyced thy joyes with bitterneſſe, that thou ſhouldeſt not forget thy ſelfe. That the Lord then, hath thus croſſed our expectations by contraries; to what ſhall we aſcribe it, but to this, that wee haue croſſed his expectation by our ſinnes? I may vſe the Apoſtles ſaying. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. For this many among you are ſicke, &amp; many are dead. The Lord of Hoaſtes hath dealt with thee, ô England as TAMBERLAINE the Great, in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieging of cities. Firſt, he erected white Tents, in token of mercy, if they would render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. Secondly, if they remained obſtinate, he erected red Tents, in ſigne of blood. Thirdly, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that preuailed no, he erected black tents, in ſigne of death. Euen ſo, the Monarcke of the worlde hath firſt erected among vs, the white Tents of mercy, by the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell. Secondly, be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>auſe we rendred not vp our hearts, he hath erected vp his red tents, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vs with an enemy without, and an enemy within. Laſtly, becauſe this hath not auailed, he hath erected the laſt yeere his blacke rents, ſending among vs mortalitie; the funerals haue walked vp and downe our ſtreetes, with mourning and lamenting; the parents for the children, the children for the parents: Let then the remaynders repent, leaſt they all likewiſe periſh. And thus much for the firſt Preacher of the former yeere, the Lordes ſmart-preacher in
<pb facs="tcp:19380:48"/> his anger and in his juſtice.</p>
               <p>There followeth now the ſecond Preacher, The Preacher of mercy, which the Lorde, whoſe mercies are infinite, hath manifeſted in three thinges:<note place="margin">2 The ſecond Preacher of the former yeere, the preacher of mercy mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in three things.</note> in the giuing of a Prince, in the fruits of the earth; in the very Plague it ſelfe. Firſt, by the gift of an honorable plant, which his right hande it ſelfe hath planted among vs: although I haue once already mentioned it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet I would not eſteeme it a tautologie to repeat it twentie and twenty times more; vnto this benefite he hath added another: The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing of him, by his holy Angels, his maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties ſafeſt garde. Firſt,<note place="margin">1 In the guift of a Prince.</note> from the ſnare of the hunter, and the noyſome peſtilence. Secondly, from intended treaſon, againſt his ſacred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Seeing the Lorde hath giuen vs a worthie inſtrument of his glorie, to beate downe the walles of that <hi>Rom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſh</hi> IERICHO: Satan would faine hinder it; and thereby ſheweth that hee hath no greater enemie in the world, then our moſt Chriſtian Prince. Satan (to vſe the words of AVGVSTINE) the former time was as a Lyon, for then he rayſed open perſecution againſt the Church: And now he playeth the ſubtile ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and priuily lyeth in waite. But although they all ſhould ſtande vp as a huge mountaine againſt our ZOROBABEL,<note place="margin">Zac. 4.7,</note> yet ſhall they bee made, I hope, a plaine as the prophet ſpeaketh. The ſecond token of his mercie, hath bene the
<pb facs="tcp:19380:49"/> bleſsing of a fruitfull yeere; the aboundance of corne,<note place="margin">2 In the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of a ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

This mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the former yeere, is a Preacher, preaching vnto you, beloued of England, (the 8. verſe of the 34. Pſalme) Taſte and ſee how gracious the Lord is. The third token of his mercie, doeth appeare in the very Peſtilence it ſelf; the Lord hauing ſhewen mercie (as the Prophet ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) in the middeſt of his juſtice.<note place="margin">3 In the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence it ſelfe, as appeareth in foure things.</note> If this ſeemeth vnto you a paradoxe, I will prooue and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt it in foure things: in regarde of the time, of the number, of the place, of the kinde of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: his mercie towardes vs, ryſing vppe by foure degrees, like the water in EZECHIEL. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.7. which at the firſt time came but to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles; the ſecond time, to the knees; the third, to his loynes; the fourth time, was a deepe riuer.

But the Lord who is mercifull, hath called backe his anger, and not ſtirred vp all his wrath. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.38. The Low-countries may Preach the Lords mercie towardes England. They haue ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times felt at one time the trinitie of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and the former yeeres, both warre and Peſtilence; wee in the meane time, feeling but the rodde of DAVID; Wee did, I confeſſe, expect a heauier judgement, wee looked for nothing elſe, but blood-ſhedding, and figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

And although our ſinnes had deſerued the heauieſt; yet he hath ſhewen to vs that mercie which he ſhewed to DAVID, not ſuffering vs to fall into the handes of men. If he had ſent vs famine, it would haue made many to haue morgaged their Landes to PHARAOS: <hi>Gen.</hi> 47.20. to haue left the kingdome <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.

The Lord hath heard our prayers. If this ſeeme ſtrange to you beloued, I will expound the paradoxe. In the beginning of the yeere, when that Noble Princeſſe Elizabeth of famous memory, fell ſicke; during her diſeaſe, wee mourned, ſighed and lamented: We were heauie and much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, many righteous ſoules prayed vnto the Lord, and in their prayers deſired two thinges <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of the Lord: firſt, that if ſhe ſhould come to die, that hee would not ſuffer them to fall into the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> hands of men; Secondly, that hee would bee
<pb facs="tcp:19380:52"/> mercyfull to <hi>Sion,</hi> and not diſpearſe and ſcatter them, but gather &amp; keepe together his church: and beholde the Lord hath heard our prayers, he hath not ſuffered vs to fal into the hands of men, he hath ſent a peſtilence, by which we are fallen into his handes: for what is the Plague but a fall into God his hands, according to the definition of DAVID. Further he hath not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed, but rather called and gathered many of vs vnto himſelfe: for what is death elſe, but a gathering vnto our fathers, &amp; a departure vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God? The Lord hath called many of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Schoole, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Schoole of this world, where they had learned no good; he hath called them to that heauenly vniuerſity. Many had deſired to ſee the tryumphes of the cittie, but the Lord in his mercy hath made them to ſee a better tryumph in that permanent Cittie and heauenly Ieruſalem. Many had deſired to ſee the Coronation of their newe Prince, but the Lord in hſs mercy hath made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſee a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Coronation, the Coronation of the Prince of glorie, &amp; of the true SALOMON Chriſt Ieſus; yea he hath made many y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> royall prieſt-hood. <hi>Apo.</hi> 1. Thus the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beloued of LONDON, I haue am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyfied vnto you the mercy of the Lord, which hath onely ſtaied the Angels ſword, or elſe, it would haue gone forward. There is no compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon betwixt the mercy of God and the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of men: It is reported that MARCELLVS,
<pb facs="tcp:19380:53"/> after that his ſouldiers had conquered SIRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CVSA, not without the great ſlaughter of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, was ſo compaſſionate ouer them, that hee went vp to the higheſt Towre in the Caſtle, &amp; with teares lamented the ruine and ouerthrow therof. Whatſoeuer may be ſaid of MARCEL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LVS for his clemencie ouer thoſe he had ſlaine, yet there is no compariſon to be made betwixt him, &amp; the Emperour of heauen and earth: hee hath had fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the high tower of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion ouer the Cittie: It hath repented him, hee hath beheld her ruines: If mercie had not bene before him, and grace behinde him, (ſo great is our ſinne) the whole Cittie might haue been deſtroyed.

Secondly, the practiſe of others, &amp; the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſucceſſe thereof.<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.3</note> DAVID tooke it in, in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: <hi>I know mine iniquities, &amp; my ſinne is euer before me,</hi> IONAS forgot it not:<note place="margin">Ionas 1.12</note>

<pb facs="tcp:19380:58"/> is a good ſigne, to knowe the diſeaſe of our ſoules: it is the firſt ſteppe to attaine vnto ſpirituall health. The firſt degree of felicitie, is not to offende: The ſecond is, hauing offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to know the offence. And although thy offence be great, yet God ſayth, NAIANZENE, is more mercifull, then man can be ſinfull, if ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> will be ſorrowful. The verie heathen-man him ſelfe, calleth them fooles that know not their faults, and reputeth their danger great. SENECA, reporting of HARPASTES a foole, who knew not that ſhee was blinde, and therefore intreated her guide to goe foorth of doores, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the houſe was darke; compareth ſuch as know not their faultes vnto this HARPAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TES, and calleth them fooles.</p>
                  <p>Further, this knowledge, maketh vs to goe vnto the Phyſition, and to ſeeke a remedie, for the curing of our diſeaſe; as the Iſraelites beeing ſtung by the fierie Serpents, fled to the Braſen Serpent. Wee are all infected with the Plague of ſinne, and yet there is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the pati nts. Some ſee it not at all: Some ſee it too much: Some feele it and feare it; Some, neither feele nor feare it. Of theſe foure ſortes, the third ſorte is onely carefull to ſeeke a remedie. Happie is the ſinner, whoſe heart doeth beginne to ſmite with DAVID. They that are ſmitten with the corporall Plague, feele paine at the heart; which often
<pb facs="tcp:19380:58"/> is a ſigne of death: But, if beeing ſmitten with the ſpirituall Plague, our hearts doe beginne once to feele it, and to ſmite vs, it is a ſigne of life. The heart is the fountaine of life; the firſt thing that liueth, and the laſt thing that dyeth: As it is firſt in corporall life, ſo let it be firſt in the ſpirituall life. The heart is like an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if it be in tune and well ſtrung, it makes a ſweet melodie. As in the repentance of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neueh,</hi> when the King beganne to ariſe from his throne, the reſt followed. So in the repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of DAVID, after that his heart (which ſits in the bodie as a King in his throne, and hath all the inferiour partes at commaund) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to ariſe, the reſt of his members follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; his mouth confeſſed, his handes put off the royall garment, and ſacrificed vnto the Lorde. The heart is like vnto a clocke, if the ballance thereof ſtirre, all the other inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and weights followe in a good courſe: But if that ſtande ſtill, euerie one of the reſt goe out of order: Euen ſo, if our hearts mooue and ſmite vs, if they ſtirre and ſteppe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, al the reſt wil follow: but if the hart ſtay, the whole body is apter to receiue any corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The ſhip is a great veſſel, but if the rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der be well guided, the whole body thereof is directed without hazard. So, if the heart go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, it goeth not alone. This is then a profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table knowledge, it is a key that openeth the
<pb facs="tcp:19380:59"/> doore to the cloſet, where all our bookes of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts doe lie: which is in the heart.

It is a ſpirituall hammer, to breake the ſtonie hardnes of our harts. This knowledge ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all humane knowledge. What is it by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmeticall account, to know the deuiſion of the leaſt fractions, and not to know that the multitude of our ſins, doe make a deuiſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and vs. What is it by Geometricall practiſe? to meaſure the longitude of the moſt ſpacious proſpects, and not to meaſure the height of our ſinnes, which aſcende as high as heauen? What is it to haue the knowledge of Muſicke, and not to know that for want of good gouernement; wee lead a life all out of tune? What is it with the Aſtronomer, to know the motion of the heauens, and to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant that our hearts lie buried in the earth?

                  <p>The ſecond parte and ingredient, is his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of health and ſpirituall life:<note place="margin">The ſeconde ingredient, deſire of health.</note> Take away the treſpaſſe of thy ſeruant. Which wordes deliuer two things: Firſt the deſire it ſelf: Secondly, the Phiſition of whom he doth deſire it (the Lord) his deſire is, remiſsion of ſinne, a healing of the Plague of the ſoule; &amp; that the Lord as a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful &amp; skilful Surgion, would take away thoſe peſtilential Carbuncles &amp; deuils-toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which were riſen in his ſoule. Among other ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents of the bodily kings medicine: the ſecond hearb, is <hi>hearb-geace,</hi> very excellent againſt the bodily infectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Inſteed of this, there is another thing which we may call <hi>Gods grace,</hi> or Chriſts grace, which is excellent to cure the infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſoule. This neceſſarie Hearbe we ſee is heere in the ſpirituall Kings medicine; for DAVID ſueth for the grace of God, to cure his euill. Hee had loſt the health of the ſoule, yea, it was like dead. For ſinne is, firſt the death of our ſelues; Secondly, the death of Chriſt. Thirdly, on the other ſide, it is the life of death: And fourthly, the life of the Deuill. And therefore DAVID prayeth his Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, to reſtore vnto him both health and life.
<pb facs="tcp:19380:60"/> Further, as the king had this deſire, ſo he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a ſtedfaſt hope, faith and confidence in the mercie of the Lord; he did not preſume or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire, but bele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ued that his health ſhould be reſtored, &amp; that his Phyſition was able to doe it. This his faith he expreſſeth in this his petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by two things: Firſt, by the name which hee giueth to his Phyſition,<note place="margin">Dauids faith and hope of mercie.</note> calling him (Lord) Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, by the name which he giueth to himſelf being the patient, calling himſelfe (his ſeruant) of thy ſeruant. Imitate the king, in the taking in of this medicine of repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Hauing obtained the knowledge of thy diſeaſe; haue a deſire of ſpirituall life and health: And ſecondly, let thy deſire be mingled with DAVIDS hope &amp; ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence in the mercies of God. Firſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire this health, and the curing of this ſore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all other things: deſire not this life, as much as the ſpirituall life: for alas, this life, as AVGVSTINE ſpeaketh, is a continuall weaknes, which followeth vs to our death. The heathen man, SOCRATES could ſay, he liueth not; who mindeth nothing but this life: for is this a life, where the houſe is but claye? the breath a vapour or ſmoke, the body a body of death, our garment corruption? As the wombe of the earth doth breede vs, ſo the wombe of the earth muſt againe receiue vs. There is a threefolde life: the life of the body, the life of the ſoule, and the life of glorie. If wee
<pb facs="tcp:19380:60"/> will obtaine the laſt, wee muſt ſeeke to get the ſecond, for as concerning the life of the body, thinke not ſaith Auguſtine, that in this life thou haſt properly health: immortalitie ſhall bee our true and perpect health. If wee eſcape the Plague of the body, and retayne the corporall life, and that our ſoules in the meane time want this life and health of the ſpirite, alas wee may eſteeme our ſelues but Dead. The Grecian Ladyes, count theyr age and the beginning of their life, from the time of theyr Marryage, not from the day of theyr Birth: and if they bee demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded how olde they bee, they beginne to reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from theyr Marriage, for then only, ſay they wee beginne to liue: Euen ſo, we may eſteeme the beginning of our life (not from the day of our birth and corporall life) for it is but a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe which paſſeth and periſheth, but from the day, that wee (as ſpirituall Virgins) haue been Married with Chriſt Ieſus, and by the vertue thereof, haue begun to liue this ſpiritual life. Sin is an vnſupportable burde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: who would not therefore with DAVID pray; Lord take it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way? Bleſſed are they whoſe ſins are bound vp in a bundle, and drawne into a narrow roome. Secondly, let thy deſire be mingled with faith, and a ſtedfaſt perſwaſion, that thy ſore ſhall be healed. Let the perſwaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the gratiouſnes &amp; kindnes of the Lord enter into your hart: for a
<pb facs="tcp:19380:61"/> man without this hope is without his beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate, the God of DAVID is yet the Lord, and thou which art infected with the infection of DAVID, art his ſeruaunt. This medicine will heale thy maladie: throwe not your blood in the ayre with IVLIAN: ſpill it not vpon the ground with SAVL: ſacrifice it not vpon a Ladder with IVDAS: the Lord doth open heauen, and you ſhut it not, hee nailed the writings vppon the Croſſe, and you renewe them not.</p>
                  <p>Hee that hath not this hope hee denyeth three thinges ſaith AVGVSTINE, the truth, the mercy, and the power of the Lorde. The knowledge of ſinne is needefull, but not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, for wee neede a double eye, one eye in our ſelues and in our ſinne, the other on Chriſt and his merits. DAVID hath had this double eye, and being conducted by mercie and faith, hee leaped out from the hot-houſe of deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As wee neede a double eye, ſo wee neede a double vertue; feare and loue: loue to looke vpon Gods mercie, feare to looke vpon his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, the firſt, to ſtay vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deſperation, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond from preſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Theſe two ſupport our faith as the two Lions ſupported SALOMONS Throne. As wee neede theſe two vertues, ſo let vs take heede from theſe two extremities, our hope is placed betwixt theſe two. As in a bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, if there be any ods in the ſcales, wee take
<pb facs="tcp:19380:61"/> out that which is the heauier, and put in that which is the lighter, till there be egalitie: Euen ſo wee muſt way ourſelues, that wee bee not too heauie for our ſinnes, deſpayring, nor too light for Chriſts mercy preſuming: theſe two are Serpents which infect the ſoules of many, treade vpon the heades of both. The Surgion doth promiſe helpe to thy ſore, and ſhalſt thou the patient thruſt thy nailes into it, and anſwere him nay, but it ſhall not bee healed? let vs therefore as Chriſtian Souldiers keepe this helmet and this buckler, and then although wee ſhould dye, yet ſhall wee liue. It is ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried of EPAMINONDAS who being ſtrick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en through with a Speare, and his blood ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, asked if his Target were ſafe, and whether the enemie were put to the flight? and vnderſtanding all to bee anſwerable to his hearrs deſire; ſayd, my fellowes in armes, it is not an ende of my life that is now come, but a better beginning. Euen ſo although we bee ſtricken with the Plague, and that our life nowe fayleth vs, this is no great loſſe, if the Target of our fayth bee ſafe, for not an ende of our life is come, but a better beginning, namelye of the life of glorye. ô yee faintyng and declining conſciences! ſet the Pillers of hope and fayth vnder you, ſayle not vpon the dangerous rocke of deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, let the breath &amp; winde of faith and hope

The conſideration of theſe ſixe qualities, ought to mooue vs to vſe no other Phyſition, then this Lorde: As long as wee are in this infectious worlde, wee ſhall neede him; for we cannot our ſelues take away our treſpaſſes: As RACHELS cattell could not drinke of the waters of the Brooke, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. before IACOB had rolled away the ſtone that couered it: euen ſo we cannot drinke in this Kings medicine, and of the waters of repentance, vnleſſe this Phyſition, who is the God of IACOB, doeth himſelfe remooue the ſtonie hardneſſe of our hearts. There hath bene a diſeaſe in this Land, called the <hi>Queenes euill,</hi> the which ſhee was able to cure: But as for the Kings euill, nobody can cure it, but the King of heauen, who is this Phyſition. Let vs make therefore much of this Phyſition. It is reported that SOCRATES neuer needeed a phyſition in his

If the weake conſciences object their vnworthines, &amp; therefore dare not preſume to goe vnto this Phyſition: Let them not feare, this Lord is alſo the Lord Ieſus, who biddeth vs to come to him <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.

Hee is a Phyſition for euery diſeaſed ſoule; the plaſter and very purgation it ſelf. For Chriſts ſake, the ſonne of this Lord, we ſhall be heard.

                  <p>A Phyſition ſaide to CONSTANTINE the Emperour, that there was no meanes to cure his leproſie; but by bathing of himſelfe in the blood of a childe: to whom he anſwered, I would rather alwaies be ſicke, then to get my health by ſuch a remedie. As for vs, beloued, we neede not vſe ſuch an anſwere; a childe is borne vnto vs, <hi>Eſ.</hi> 9. In whoſe blood we may waſh the leproſie and plague of our ſinne.

In which fewe words is deſcribed, the ſick-mans cure in foure things: The Phſition curing the ſicke patient; the Phyſicke curing; the operation of the Phyſicke. Before I ende this poynt,<note place="margin">Many not contented with king Dauids Phyſition.</note> let me let before your eyes a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of bewitched Idolaters, who erre both in the medicine, and the Phyſition. The Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticiaries runne to their workes; The Vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to their vowes: the ſuperſtitious, to the Pope, and to Sainct SEBASTION, vſing not the Prayer of DAVID, Lorde take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie the treſpaſſe of thy ſeruant, but, <hi>Sancte</hi> SVDARI, <hi>ora pro nobis, &amp; ſudarium Chriſti liberet nos a peſte &amp; morte triſti.</hi> O holie NAPKIN,
<pb facs="tcp:19380:64"/> pray for vs, and deliuer vs from the Peſtilence, and euil death. But let the Pope promiſe health by his pardons, Buls and indulgences, they are but euen a potion of ranke poyſon, prepared by the Diuell his Apothecary.</p>
                  <p>This is a counterfaite phyſicke which cannot purge: This Phyſition hath deceiued his Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, and hath wrought no more cure on the ſoules of men, then ELISHA his ſtaffe did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer the SVNAMITES childe when GEHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ZI laide it vpon the face thereof. 2. <hi>Reg-</hi> 4-3- The Popes patients are ſicke ſtill, for all the Popes drugges, and ſtill will be, as the SVNA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MITES childe was deade till ELISHA came.</p>

As the trauailer that hath beene round about the world, is not therefore the neerer heauen; euen ſo, when yee ſhall haue compaſſed all the world, yee ſhall not bee the neerer to Chriſt the true Phyſition. As the Doue then found no reſt, till ſhe returned to the Arke, euen ſo you ſhal finde no reſt for your diſtreſſed conſciences till you returne to Chriſt Ieſus.

DAVID hearing the will of the Lord by the Prophet GAD, that the Lord would ſend a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence in Iſraell, hee murmureth and grudgeth not, but receiued patiently the hand of God. Firſt, hee doth not alleadge or produce any thing, in regard of his ſinne, to excuſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate the ſame; Secondly, in regarde of the puniſhment propounded, to aggrauate it: but poſſeſſing his ſoule in patience, hee breaketh forth into theſe words; Let vs fall into the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of God. Imitate and followe the king in the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in of the kings medicine, if the Lord viſit thee with the rod of <hi>Dauid,</hi> or with any other calamity. The third hearb of the kings medicine for the bodie, are <hi>Bramble leaues.</hi> In ſteade of theſe, take the hearbe of patience, ſo called in euery mans mouth: for as the common prouerb is, Patience is a good hearb, but it groweth not in euery mans garden, As for the bramble, leaue him out,<note place="margin">Three reaſons to vrge the vſe of it.</note> for hee exalted himſelfe aboue the other trees. <hi>Iud.</hi> 9.15. Three things ought to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> mooue vs to vſe this excellent hearbe. Firſt, it is preſcribed by the colledge of the ſpirituall Phyſitians. Chriſt himſelfe commaundeth the vſe thereof. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.19. Poſſeſſe your ſoules with patience. DAVID the King <hi>Pſalme</hi> 37.7.
<pb facs="tcp:19380:65"/> Waite patiently vpon the Lord. Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the practiſe of others, the renowned Patriarks, the bleſſed Prophets, the religious Kings, the holy Apoſtles,<note place="margin">The effectes of it.</note> the godly troupe of Martyres <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> haue vſed it. Thirdly, the excellent effectes, qualities, properties, and operations of this hearbe: The firſt is, to preuent and to preſerue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> vs from the poyſon and contagion of immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate feare of death, ſickneſſe, or of any other calamitie. The ſecond is, when thou art viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to expell the venome and poyſon of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience from thy mouth, and thy heart. The ſick man, although hee throweth off his cloathes, and toſſeth himſelfe from ſide to ſide in the bedde for mitigation of paines, is not thereby holpen, the ſickneſſe ſtill remaineth, this is the onely hearbe to eaſe him. If the carbuncle and filthy botch of impatience brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth forth, here is a playſter to cure the wound. It will drawe foorth the venome, and make vs to humble our ſelues vnder the mightie hande of GOD. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.6. Patience, is <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumna dei,</hi> the daughter of GOD, ſaith TERTVLLIAN: for want of which, many are like birds in lime or ſnares, which the more they ſtriue to eſcape, the more they are limed &amp; ſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. As the hearbs then of the bodily kings me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, are vſed both before infection &amp; after in fection: eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo the hearb of patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is good both for the vnuiſited to preuent, and for the viſited
<pb facs="tcp:19380:66"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to expell. Thirdly, this hearbe will eaſe and mollifie thy paine: plaiſters are vſed to ſweeten, mollifie, and mitigate the paine, euen ſo the plaiſter of patience will make vs to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all our troubles. The heathens haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged this; for one ſaith, He that endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth patiently, ouercommeth his paine. This then will make vs to ſay with DAVID, Lord becauſe thou diddeſt it, I am dumbe. It filleth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the heart with comfort &amp; ſpirituall ioy. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> it doth ſtrengthen vs. <hi>Prou.</hi> 16.32. Fiftly, it will heale, and make vs perfect in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.4. It mooueth the Lord to pittie and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> mercie. <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.11. Sixtly, it is good cheape, it will not coſt golde or ſiluer, onely pray for it, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> and the Kings Phyſition will giue it you. Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenthly, it is <hi>an vniuerſall remedie,</hi> for all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men, for all diſeaſes, and at all times, not onely for the time of Plague, but for the time of famine, warre and pouertie. PLINIE ſaith, that the earth <hi>Para</hi> cureth al manner of wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds; this property may better be attributed to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian patience. If the patient reply, that the hearbe of patience is not like vnto the hearbes of the bodily kings medicine, for they are to be founde in euery mans Garden, and ſo is not this; I can giue him no other anſwere but this, Let him pray for it, and hee ſhall obtaine it. As for impatience, ſeeing that it is borne of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, as TERTVLLIAN ſpeaketh, to him let
<pb facs="tcp:19380:66"/> vs leaue this plant which the hand of the Lord neuer planted, and to his male-contented Imps, who neuer learned how the linkes of that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly chaine are faſtened one to another,<note place="margin">Rom. 5</note> that tribulation bringeth patience, patience experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, experience hope.

Let vs Chriſtians hang vpon the chaine, and clime to heauen by it, through the merits of Chriſtes death and paſſion, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the laſt linke conſiſteth. Let vs not ill entreat the Lords Embaſſadors. DAVID tooke it not well when the AMONITES ill entreated his Embaſſadours: afflictions are Gods Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors; to repine or grudge againſt them, is to entreate them ill. I end with the wordes of AVGVSTINE; Let vs not regarde ſo much what part wee haue in the whippe, but what place in the Teſtament.

And although a king, yet he forgetteth his glorie, ſetteth affection aſide, writeth, as it were, his fault in his browe, and pointeth with his finger at his tranſgreſſion.

Firſt, the nature of your diſeaſe, that is of ſinne, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it: as long as it is hidden, it biteth as a Scorpion which we hide in our boſome.

Fiftly, the end and purpoſe of the Lord, the ſupreame Phyſition, for which hee doth ſend thee corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall afflictions; which is, that thou ſhouldeſt confeſſe. As the malefactour is put vpon the torture that hee ſhould diſcouer the trueth: euen ſo the Lord in the ſending of corporall
<pb facs="tcp:19380:68"/> afflictions, doth, as it were, put vs vpon the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that we ſeeing our members either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of our owne perſons, or of our children and friends, as it were ſtretched out by the greatneſſe of the paines, might be enforced to crie <hi>peccaui:</hi> lord I haue done fooliſhly.

               <p>And ſo DAVID, as a good phyſitian, giueth vnto his diſeaſe, her proper and indiuiduall name, cloaking it not with the name of vertue. Imitate the King, and giue vnto the childe, as the prouerbe is, the right name. Further hee expreſſeth the right nature of the plague of the ſoule, calling it <hi>fooliſhneſſe.</hi> The nature of ſome diſeaſes is ſuch,<note place="margin">The vnmaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked plague.</note> that as the phyſitians affirme, and experience teacheth, they make the diſeaſed madde and phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke: this is the nature of the ſpirituall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion, it is a ſpirituall phrenſie and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and the ſinners infected therewith, what are they but fools, phrenticks &amp; mad men? That this is the nature of ſin, the plague of the ſoule,
<pb facs="tcp:19380:70"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> is prooued by 3. arguments, Firſt, this is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion and determination of the whole col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the ſpirituall phyſitians,<note place="margin">Three argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſin.</note> of the bleſſed trinity, who attributeth this name to the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous <hi>Luc.</hi> 12. to the Atheiſt <hi>Pſ.</hi> 14.1. to the careleſſe wiſe man <hi>Ierem</hi> 8-8-9-Eſ. 56-10-to the ſtifnecked <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 38.5. to the ignorant <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.

Secondly, it is proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the name of the medicine which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to heale this plague, the medicine of repentance: both the greeke and the hebrew name doe prooue it. Firſt the greek name, which is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                  </gap>, which implieth as much, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come wiſe or better aduiſed after the fact. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> then, or repentance, is a forſaking of our former follies which before we had frequented. Secondly the hebrew name Theſchouba, which ſignifieth a returning, becauſe ſinners as fooles and mad men, haue runne out of the way, but by repentance they returne back from the deuil, the world, themſelues, to God, the church, themſelues. Thirdly by their <hi>actions.</hi> What are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the actions of the drunkard, of the angry man, of the ſwaggering ſwearer, yea of the vaine daunſer, as <hi>Cicero</hi> a heathen doth witneſſe, but the actions of fooles and mad men? Of him that caſteth himſelfe with a ſet purpoſe into the fire or water what doe we iudge, but that he is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:19380:70"/> a foole or a mad man? What doth the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate ſinner elſe, but caſt himſelfe into the fire? This is then the nature of ſinne, the plague of the ſoule, by the iudgement of the beſt phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians who could not erre.</p>
               <p>Touching the nature of this diſeaſe,<note place="margin">The iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of bad phyſitians touching ſin.</note> there is another iudgement and determination, the iudgement of bad phyſitians, of the deuill, the fleſh, and the worldling. The deuill is craftie in minſing ſinne, the fleſh and the worldling diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe them vnder the habite of vertues, cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them with that honorable name. Pride is, by the iudgement of this colledge, cleanlineſſe and handſomeneſſe. The painting of faces, friz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of haire, comely ornaments. Malice, enuie, and reuenge, manhood. Gluttonie and rioting, good fellowſhippe. Fornication, a tricke of youth. Briberie, the taking of their fees and their dutie, Simonie, gratitude and thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Drunkenneſſe, merrineſſe. Couetouſneſſe, parſimonie and good husbandrie. Prodigalitie, liberalitie. Oppreſſion, iuſtice. The dingthrift a great houſekeeper. The worldling, a wiſe man and a good politician. The good preacher, a railer, the dumbdogge a good fellow. The ſwaggering ſwearer, a fine gentleman. The zealous man a preciſian. Thus we ſee that ſins, hauing gotten a liuerie of their maſter the diuell and ſtolen the cloake of vertue, doe iet it, and braue it vp and downe, like fidlers and players,

It is maintained by the vulgar experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that the bodily plague doth, or can lye &amp; ſticke in the apparell; and by this meanes, that others are infected: whether this be true or no I can not affirme.

Let vs then, belooued, bee carefull to get theſe garments, if wee will drinke this ſpirituall Kings medicine. The Heathens beeing inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, had for their bankets, and went to their feaſts, with white garments, which they called <hi>veſtes coenatorias,</hi> which were alſo vſed among the Iewes, as PHILO writeth; and they which wore them, were called <hi>Candidati:</hi> the Lord doth inuite vs this year to the Kings feaſt, which is repentance, and that by a ioyfull deliuerance, as hee inuited vs the former yeare by his ſmart-Preacher. Ought wee not then to haue the white garment of integritie to put on? The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer yeare, men haue ayred and perfumed their apparell with diuers ſents and odoriferous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to reſiſt the poyſon and infection of the ayre, let vs this yeare perfume them

Let vs then, beloued, with theſe Elders, in this life be cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with the penetentiall garment, that in the life to come we may put on thoſe white robes <hi>Reu.</hi> 7.13. wherewith the Saintes and Elders were adorned: let vs not ſeeke to bee as the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wormes, to ſhine here onely beneath, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after wee may ſhine aboue as the ſtarres in the firmament. And thus much for the garments to put on.</p>
               <p>Before I proceede, I will ſhewe you yet one thing; The Kings medicine aganſt the bodily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection muſt bee taken in, faſting,<note place="margin">The ſpirituall Kings medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, is to bee taken in, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting.</note> as you may ſee in the medicine it ſelf, prefixed before the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, &amp; as the practiſe of the former yeare doth alſo witneſſe: Euen ſo this ſpirituall Kings me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine of repentance againſt the ſpiritual Plague muſt bee taken in, faſting. There is a twofolde faſt; Firſt, a corporall and an outward; Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a ſpirituall and an inward. As for <hi>Dauid</hi> &amp; the Elders of Iſraell, whither they haue faſted or no, it is not here expreſſed; but yet it may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued that they haue. As for you, beloued of <hi>London,</hi> firſt you haue taken in the Kings medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine for the bodie, faſting. Secondly, you haue alſo begunne to take in this ſpirituall Kings me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine faſting; witneſſe the weekely faſtings of the former yeare. Being now come vnto the

Forget not ſo much to forſake ordinarie foode, as to impriſon and ſhut vp your bodies from the vanities and pleaſures of this life; pull downe the ſtrength and pride thereof. The honour of a faſt, to vſe the words of <hi>Chriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,</hi> is not abſtinence from meates, but auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ſinne. Doſt thou faſt? ſhewe mee thy faſting by thy workes. If thou askeſt what kinde of workes? If thou ſeeſt a poore man, take mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie on him, if thine enemie, reconcile thy ſelfe. If thy friend deſeruing praiſe, enuie him not. If a beautiful woman, make a couenant with thine eyes. For what auaileth it, ſaith <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thy belly of foode, and to fill thy ſoule with ſinnes, to be pale for faſting and to bee blewe and pale for hate and enuie; to drinke no wine, and to be drunke with the poyſon of anger; to abſtaine from things which are lawfull, and to doe things which are vnlawfull? Follow then, beloued, the counſaile of <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> and <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> who both iumpe togither: Let not onely thy mouth and thy bowels faſt, but thine eyes,
<pb facs="tcp:19380:81"/> thine eares, thy feete, thy handes, and all thy bodily members. Let thy hands faſt from rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery, thy feete from bearing thee to vnlawfull ſpectacles, thine eares from ſucking in ſla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derous tales, thine eyes from receiuing in wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.

The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the former yeare hath ſhewed the truth of that Prouerbe; <hi>As many daies, as many liues.</hi> They who one day carried the deade bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to the graues, were themſelues on the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> carried by others.

Firſt, delay doth caſt our owne perſons in daunger, both bodie and ſoule; the bodie in the danger of the fire of the Plague: the ſoule of the fire of hell: both of the fire of Gods heauie indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. To quench this three-folde fire, wee muſt take in the Kings medicine in due ſeaſon. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> wee caſt others in danger; doe wee not ſee, that our little children, doe, as it were, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with vs, and helpe to beare the puniſhment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of our delay and procraſtination? Thirdly, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay encreaſeth our diſeaſe; and laſtly, maketh it incurable. It fareth with the plague of ſinne, as with a tempeſt vpon the ſea, in which there are firſt little waues; afterwards, greater volumes of waters: and then, perhaps, ſurges mounting vp as high as heauen. Or it is like vnto the breedes
<pb facs="tcp:19380:84"/> of ſerpents, firſt an egge, 2. a cockatrice, thirdlie a ſerpent. To preuent this encreaſing take in the Kings medicine betimes. Auncient woundes ſayth IEROME, are not cured in haſte, the play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter muſt lie long vpon them; euen ſo our olde feſtered ſinnes can not bee done away with a dayes repentaunce. The ſnow ball the more it is rouled, the greater it waxeth; the more ſinnes we commit, the more walls of braſſe wee builde vp betwixt God and vs: ſo that at laſt, our cryes can not haue paſſage vnto him, nor his mercyes vnto vs. The longer the blowe bee in fetching, the heauier wil the wound be when it commeth. And the deeper the arrow be drawn in the bowe the deeper it pearceth when it is let flee. Sinne creepeth foorth like a canker, if in time it bee not medicined. As of the ſickneſſe of the body, ſo of the ſoule there are criticall dayes, knowne to God, whereby he doth gueſſe, whether we be in likelihoode to recouer health, and to harken to the holeſome counſailes of his lawe or not. If then the lorde take his time to giue vs ouer to our ſelues and the malignitie of our diſeaſes, we may ſay too late as ſometime Chriſt, of Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, O that we had knowne the things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to our peace, but now they are hid from vs. As I will not promiſe, ſo I dare not preſume ſaith AVSTIN, of euening repenters: to make all out of doubt, the beſt courſe is to repent betimes. The fourth motiue, are the impediments which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
                  <pb facs="tcp:19380:85"/> will hinder vs to take in the Kings medicine, if we ſlip the opportunity, &amp; the firſt ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel of time. If it be differed to old age, or to ſickneſſe, two impedimentes will be in the way, <hi>outward,</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
                  <hi>inward:</hi> Firſt, outward impediments, thy wife &amp; children enuironing thee, thy friends whiſpering in thine eares to make thy Wil, and to remember ſuch and ſuch a friend; ſo that repentance being differred, will be either <hi>nulla, vel ficta, vel diffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> either none at all, or counterfeit, or very hard. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The other impedimentes, will be, the multitude of thy ſinnes, feare of death, the terrour of the law, the obiections of Sathan, the accuſations of thy conſcience. True is the ſaying of AM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BROSE, <hi>nulla ſeria penitentia eſt nimis ſera, ſed rarò tam ſera eſt ſeria.</hi> No ſerious repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is too late: but yet ſeldom, a late repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is a ſerious repentaunce. <hi>Yong men,</hi> take in betimes the Kings medicine, ſpend not the ſtrength, ſap, and greeneneſſe of your youth, ſeaſon your greene veſſels with the liquor of Gods ſpirite, and offer vnto him the maidenheade of your youth. <hi>Old men,</hi> take it alſo in due ſeaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, differre it not, to the houre of death: for if you doe, you treade vpon yee, which if it be molten with a little heate of Gods anger, alas you ſhall ſinke into the gulfe of deſtruction. Yong age truſt not to olde age, thou leaneſt vpon a brittle ſtaffe, which when it breakes, the ſplinters and ſhiuers thereof will wound thee. Both of
<pb facs="tcp:19380:85"/> you, offer not the dregges of your life vnto god, leaſte yee drinke the dregges of his anger. The common ſaying is true, <hi>vita breuis, ars longa,</hi> life is ſhort, and the arte of ſaluation requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a long time of learning. Fiftlie, your owne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> diligence, beloued of London, in the taking in of the bodilie Kings medicine in due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for the preſeruation of your bodies, ought to put you in minde of the care and diligence which you ought to haue for your ſoules. You haue not differred to take in preſeruatiues till the infection had wonne the vitall partes: let the health of your ſoules bee dearer vnto you, then the health of your bodies.
